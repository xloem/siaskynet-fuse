CHANGE NEEDED: the skynet interface doesn't provide for upload multiply nested folders.  Instead things must be uploaded with full pathname, and they
               are returned as a flat list.  This changes the `sky_entry` structure and behavior.
CHANGE RECOMMENDED: `sky_entry` shouold become the intuitive way of interacting with things.  It should be possible to query it for its children.
NOTE: plan is to use text/uri-list for links to deeper trees.  This provides for representing them with multiple possible uri's.  Could put a content-hash in the content-type.
