we'll likely want something that can be nested in a directory to represent a subdirectory.
maybe give it characters that are illegal in a pathname.


	one issue is when the contents of a folder change, it kinda looks like
	the whole hierarchy might change, all the way up

	it would be nice to only change one file when that happens.
	
	one thing we could do is merge other files in

	anyway, skynet appears made of files that have names, lengths, and subfiles
	so roughly directories

	we could serialize these to storage, read/write them, and then merge them

	or we could use something different for directory indexing

	how about we actually do do it all the way up
	and use links to other files, as files. this sounds helpful.

	we'll want a local cache and a sense of what has been synchronized.

	link name?  can this be a file with a special content?
	can we set the content type on upload?
	that would do it, but it doesn't happen on siaskynetpp
